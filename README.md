# MCProtocolLib
MCProtocolLib is a simple library for communicating with a Minecraft client/server. It aims to allow people to make custom bots, clients, or servers for Minecraft easily.

## About this fork
This is a fork of the last 1.8.8 commit I was able to find. I've updated some of the pom file and such, so it will at least compile, but you still may need to tweak the code a bit to get everything functional. 

Neither me or the original developers will offer support for this version. 

Check out the original repo: https://github.com/GeyserMC/MCAuthLib

## Example Code
See example/org/spacehq/mc/protocol/test
